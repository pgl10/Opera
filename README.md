# Opera
The Opera programming language is performing mathematically exact arithmetic operations<br>
<br>
Opera performs the mathematically exact operations on rational numbers of any size, as big as needed. The command files are true small programs.<br>
<br>
The class bigRa implements a rational number with its numerator and its denominator using the GMP library working like normal arithmetic created by Paul Herman.<br>
<br>
Each number of this class has a name and its value. These numbers may be defined or red, computed and saved.<br>
<br>
The code is able to perform seven arithmetic operations. The user can enter commands on the keyboard but he can also use files of commands. The syntax of these commands is very simple. And here i = 1/0 = infinity can be used as other rational numbers.<br>
<br>
Opera is available on Windows and Linux : source, project, executable, examples, documentation.<br>
