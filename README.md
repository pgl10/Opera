# Opera
Rational numbers of any size (as big as needed)<br>
<br>
Opera performs the mathematically exact operations to rational numbers of any size. The command files are true small programs.<br>
<br>
The class bigRa implements a rational number with its numerator and its denominator being integer numbers of any size, as big as needed, using the GMP library working like normal arithmetic created by Paul Herman.<br>
<br>
Each number of this class has a name and its value. These numbers are members of a set where they may be defined or red, computed and saved.<br>
<br>
The code is able to perform the five basic operations. The user can enter commands on the keyboard but he can also use a file of commands. The syntax of these commands is very simple. And here i = 1/0 = infinity can be used as other rational numbers.<br>
